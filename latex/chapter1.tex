\label{chapter:introduction}

Over the last decades, there have been a rising dependence on technology, cross-cutting every sector. The increasing and fast growth of the society is directly related to technological development as it aims to solve everyday problems. Each person, company or industry rely closely on technology.


However, this dependence comes with a cost, energy, which is the technology main resource and the most expensive one. This fact, urged society into finding affordable and environmentally friendly ways of generating energy, such as renewable energies. Yet, this type of energy producers have harmful effects on the landscape preservation and are way more expensive than fossil energy producers. With this factors in mind, the solution for energy problems should be trying to reduce as much as possible the consume of energy around the globe and not only trying to find cheap ways of producing it.

The amount of energy consumed in the buildings sector is 20.1\% of the total energy consumed worldwide. This numbers have been acting as an influence for finding efficient ways of reducing the energy consumption in this sector. There are already several solutions in BAS's (Building Automation Systems) which achieved quite good results in automation mechanisms to reduce energy consumption in buildings. However, almost every BAS solution isn't OpenSource nor can be used with custom hardware, i.e all the hardware, installation and management need to be done by the same vendor. Moreover, this systems almost not allowing complex correlation between events is a powerful downside. Simple action-reaction systems are not enough.
