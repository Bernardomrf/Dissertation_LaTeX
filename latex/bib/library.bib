abstract = {The literature concerning man-computer transactions abounds in controversy about the limits of "system response time" to a user's command or inquiry at a terminal. Two major semantic issues prohibit resolving this controversy. One issue centers around the question of "Response time to what?" The implication is that different human purposes and actions will have different acceptable or useful response times.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. One of the challenges faced by today's Internet of Things (IoT) is to efficiently support machine-To-machine communication, given that the remote sensors and the gateway devices are connected through low bandwidth, unreliable, or intermittent wireless communication links. In this paper, we quantitatively compare the performance of IoT protocols, namely MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), DDS (Data Distribution Service) and a custom UDP-based protocol in a medical setting. The performance of the protocols was evaluated using a network emulator, allowing us to emulate a low bandwidth, high system latency, and high packet loss wireless access network. This paper reports the observed performance of the protocols and arrives at the conclusion that although DDS results in higher bandwidth usage than MQTT, its superior performance with regard to data latency and reliability makes it an attractive choice for medical IoT applications and beyond.},

abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a novel approach how to process streaming events and extract information that would otherwise be lost. While tools for CEP are available right now, they are usually used only for a limited number of projects. That is disappointing, because every Enterprise Information System (EIS) is producing a high number of events, e.g. by logging debug information, and industry is not taking an advantage of CEP to make these information useful. We pick two concepts that seems to be from a different category - notifications - a ubiquitous way how to notify user of an EIS and EIS monitoring. With notifications we define a new abstraction upon notifications with respect to a separation of concerns to create a more maintainable implementation. In our research we show that this is a typical example of a possible future application of CEP and that the industry requires specific service oriented tools that can be used for both, notifications and monitoring. When these service oriented tools would be introduced into the industry it would promote EIS maintainability and extensibility. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything—including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history. Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge, and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important. Already, IoT projects are under way that promise to close the gap between poor and rich, improve distribution of the world's resources to those who need them most, and help us understand our planet so we can be more proactive and less reactive. Even so, several barriers exist that threaten to slow IoT development, including the transition to IPv6, having a common set of standards, and developing energy sources for millions—even billions—of minute sensors. However, as businesses, governments, standards bodies, and academia work together to solve these challenges, IoT will continue to progress. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to educate you in plain and simple terms so you can be well versed in IoT and understand its potential to change everything we know to be true today.},

abstract = {Overview Energy consumed in the buildings sector consists of residential and commercial end users and accounts for 20.1{\%} of the total delivered energy consumed worldwide. Consumption of delivered, or site, energy contrasts with the use of the primary energy that also includes the energy used to generate and deliver electricity to individual sites such as homes, offices, or industrial plants. In the International Energy Outlook 2016 (IEO2016) Reference case, delivered energy consumption in buildings worldwide increases by an average of 1.5{\%}/ year from 2012 to 2040. In the non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) nations, consumption of delivered energy in buildings grows by 2.1{\%}/year from 2012 to 2040, nearly three times the growth rate for the OECD nations. Residential sector Energy consumption in the residential sector includes all energy consumed by households, excluding transportation uses. 253 It includes energy used for heating, cooling, lighting, water heating, and consumer products. Energy consumption in the residential sector is affected by income levels, energy prices, location, building and household characteristics, weather, efficiency and type of equipment, energy access, availability of energy sources, and energy-related policies, among other factors. As a result, the type and amount of energy consumed by households can vary significantly within and across regions and countries. In the IEO2016 Reference case, residential sector energy use accounts for about 13{\%} of total world delivered energy consumption in 2040. Delivered energy consumption in the residential sector grows by an average of 1.4{\%}/year from 2012 to 2040, increasing by a total of 48{\%} over the entire period. Residential energy use in the non-OECD nations increases by an average of 2.1{\%}/year from 2012 to 2040 in the Reference case and accounts for 80{\%} of all growth in world residential energy use over the 28-year period. OECD residential sector energy use grows much more slowly, averaging 0.6{\%}/year over the same period, but residential energy consumption per capita remains higher in OECD countries than in non-OECD countries through 2040.},

abstract = {Following the widespread adoption of building management systems, driven mostly by building energy efficiency concerns, Building Automation has earned a great deal of attention. Indeed, an increasing number of stakeholders have put their efforts in the Building Automation market, developing devices and software solutions. It is well known that Building Automation technology is characterized by heterogeneity, in that solutions from different manufacturers cannot be easily integrated with each other, and that costumers are often forced to pick a single line of products, therefore, leading to costumer lock-in situations as well as increasing installation and maintenance costs. However, given the popularity of the subject, one startling aspect of Building Automation is the scarcity of authoritative literature references regarding the topic---definition inconsistency and disagreement are recurring issues. Moreover, automation technology specifications and manufacturer documentation are prevalently leading to a lack of coverage of the entire spectrum of functionality expected from modern automation systems. This results in communication difficulties between system developers further hindering the efforts to overcome heterogeneity. This article systematizes fundamental automation aspects, comprehensively defining each concept based upon established literature standards. Having these aspects as guidelines, we assess the required functionality of a Building Automation System and compare the main Building Automation specification standards available. We conclude that none of the analyzed specifications are able to totally cover the surveyed functionality span, leaving to developers and manufacturers the responsibility of creating custom extensions to fill functionality gaps, thus hindering the interoperability between different technologies.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm in which smart objects actively collaborate with other physical and virtual resources available in the Internet. IoT environments are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, encompassing devices with different capabilities, functionalities, and network protocols. To address such a heterogeneity, some platforms have been proposed aiming at abstracting away the specificities of such devices and promoting interoperability among them. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization in IoT makes these platforms to often not properly address several important requirements in this context. In this context, reference architectures can define an initial set of building blocks for IoT environments and to provide a solid foundation for leveraging its wide adoption. In this paper, we introduce two recent reference architectures for IoT, namely the IoT Architectural Reference Model and the architecture proposed by WSO2. By analyzing the characteristics of these architectures, we intend to shed light on important issues for future research on reference architectures for IoT.},

The wireless system is constructed on top of 6LoWPAN energy efficient communication infrastructure to maximize the operation time. Fault tolerance is achieved via backup routing between nodes and advanced service mechanisms to maintain connectivity in case of failing connections between system nodes. The presented fault tolerance approach covers many fault situations such as malfunction of sink node hardware and traffic bottleneck at a node due to a high receiving data rate. A method for extending the number of medical sensing nodes at a single gateway is presented. A complete system architecture providing a quantity of features from bio-signal acquisition such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Electromyography (EMG) to the representation of graphical waveforms of these gathered bio-signals for remote real-time monitoring is proposed.},

abstract = {With yearly shipments of more than 10 billion microcontrollers that all can exchange information locally or through the Internet, a huge variety of so called " intelligent devices " are enabled. All these devices can be accessed over the Internet and this evolution is commonly referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT typically requires a local low power wireless connection along with the Internet connection. For most such applications and solutions, a gateway is required to connect sensor nodes to the Internet via a local infrastructure or using a cellular connection. Gateways are important components of the IoT vision. These gateways can be used to connect Bluetooth low energy devices to the Internet and can also be used as "repeaters" to extend the system range. This whitepaper describes how Bluetooth low energy technology works and how it can be used to connect devices to Internet-based services and applications. A significant feature in Bluetooth low energy compared to other IoT wireless technologies is the support for smartphones and tablets. The whitepaper thus also describes how a smartphone or tablet can be used in IoT.},

Such trends create ever new challenges for optimizing energy usage for heating, ventilation, lighting, entertainment, and domestic chores. Occupancy driven energy efficient Building Automation System (BAS) is one of the highly active research areas, as it contributes in energy savings and reduction of carbon emissions. This work focuses on the study of enhancing the energy efficiency of physically undivided large building spaces where occupancy and the priority of the zones would have statistical variability. The real occupancy status of different zones are obtained by means of occupancy sensor outputs, and are used to control indoor climate; but with optimality constraints in energy consumption for both the automation networks, and all the systems work in the building space. Also an algorithm is proposed for power scheduling in sensor nodes to reduce energy consumption and to extend network lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Thus, the development of a comprehensive security concept is of utmost importance. This paper starts with a security threat analysis and identifies the challenges of providing security in the building automation domain. Afterward, the security mechanisms of available standards are thoroughly analyzed.

abstract = {IEEE 802.11ah is an emerging Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard that defines a WLAN system operating at sub 1 GHz license-exempt bands. Thanks to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide much improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks, extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. In this paper, we give a technical overview of 802.11ah Physical (PHY) layer and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. For the 802.11ah PHY, which is designed based on the down-clocked operation of IEEE 802.11ac's PHY layer, we describe its channelization and transmission modes. Besides, 802.11ah MAC layer has adopted some enhancements to fulfill the expected system requirements. These enhancements include the improvement of power saving features, support of large number of stations, efficient medium access mechanisms and throughput enhancements by greater compactness of various frame formats. Through the numerical analysis, we evaluate the transmission range for indoor and outdoor environments and the theoretical throughput with newly defined channel access mechanisms.},
