abstract = {Building automation systems are traditionally concerned with the control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, as well as lighting and shading, systems. They have their origin in a time where security has been considered as a side issue at best. Nowadays, with the rising desire to integrate security-critical services that were formerly provided by isolated subsystems, security must no longer be neglected. Thus, the development of a comprehensive security concept is of utmost importance. This paper starts with a security threat analysis and identifies the challenges of providing security in the building automation domain. Afterward, the security mechanisms of available standards are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, two approaches that provide both secure communication and secure execution of possibly untrusted control applications are presented.},

abstract = {Higher density of population in the urban settings demand more space, and the mechanism to deal with the exponential growth of such demands is to use the three dimensional space for the future smart cities, than the conventional planar dwellings. Such trends create ever new challenges for optimizing energy usage for heating, ventilation, lighting, entertainment, and domestic chores. Occupancy driven energy efficient Building Automation System (BAS) is one of the highly active research areas, as it contributes in energy savings and reduction of carbon emissions. This work focuses on the study of enhancing the energy efficiency of physically undivided large building spaces where occupancy and the priority of the zones would have statistical variability. The real occupancy status of different zones are obtained by means of occupancy sensor outputs, and are used to control indoor climate; but with optimality constraints in energy consumption for both the automation networks, and all the systems work in the building space. Also an algorithm is proposed for power scheduling in sensor nodes to reduce energy consumption and to extend network lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm in which smart objects actively collaborate with other physical and virtual resources available in the Internet. IoT environments are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, encompassing devices with different capabilities, functionalities, and network protocols. To address such a heterogeneity, some platforms have been proposed aiming at abstracting away the specificities of such devices and promoting interoperability among them. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization in IoT makes these platforms to often not properly address several important requirements in this context. In this context, reference architectures can define an initial set of building blocks for IoT environments and to provide a solid foundation for leveraging its wide adoption. In this paper, we introduce two recent reference architectures for IoT, namely the IoT Architectural Reference Model and the architecture proposed by WSO2. By analyzing the characteristics of these architectures, we intend to shed light on important issues for future research on reference architectures for IoT.},

abstract = {IEEE 802.11ah is an emerging Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard that defines a WLAN system operating at sub 1 GHz license-exempt bands. Thanks to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide much improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks, extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. In this paper, we give a technical overview of 802.11ah Physical (PHY) layer and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. For the 802.11ah PHY, which is designed based on the down-clocked operation of IEEE 802.11ac's PHY layer, we describe its channelization and transmission modes. Besides, 802.11ah MAC layer has adopted some enhancements to fulfill the expected system requirements. These enhancements include the improvement of power saving features, support of large number of stations, efficient medium access mechanisms and throughput enhancements by greater compactness of various frame formats. Through the numerical analysis, we evaluate the transmission range for indoor and outdoor environments and the theoretical throughput with newly defined channel access mechanisms.},

@article{BuildingEnergy,
abstract = {Overview Energy consumed in the buildings sector consists of residential and commercial end users and accounts for 20.1{\%} of the total delivered energy consumed worldwide. Consumption of delivered, or site, energy contrasts with the use of the primary energy that also includes the energy used to generate and deliver electricity to individual sites such as homes, offices, or industrial plants. In the International Energy Outlook 2016 (IEO2016) Reference case, delivered energy consumption in buildings worldwide increases by an average of 1.5{\%}/ year from 2012 to 2040. In the non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (non-OECD) nations, consumption of delivered energy in buildings grows by 2.1{\%}/year from 2012 to 2040, nearly three times the growth rate for the OECD nations. Residential sector Energy consumption in the residential sector includes all energy consumed by households, excluding transportation uses. 253 It includes energy used for heating, cooling, lighting, water heating, and consumer products. Energy consumption in the residential sector is affected by income levels, energy prices, location, building and household characteristics, weather, efficiency and type of equipment, energy access, availability of energy sources, and energy-related policies, among other factors. As a result, the type and amount of energy consumed by households can vary significantly within and across regions and countries. In the IEO2016 Reference case, residential sector energy use accounts for about 13{\%} of total world delivered energy consumption in 2040. Delivered energy consumption in the residential sector grows by an average of 1.4{\%}/year from 2012 to 2040, increasing by a total of 48{\%} over the entire period. Residential energy use in the non-OECD nations increases by an average of 2.1{\%}/year from 2012 to 2040 in the Reference case and accounts for 80{\%} of all growth in world residential energy use over the 28-year period. OECD residential sector energy use grows much more slowly, averaging 0.6{\%}/year over the same period, but residential energy consumption per capita remains higher in OECD countries than in non-OECD countries through 2040.},

abstract = {Following the widespread adoption of building management systems, driven mostly by building energy efficiency concerns, Building Automation has earned a great deal of attention. Indeed, an increasing number of stakeholders have put their efforts in the Building Automation market, developing devices and software solutions. It is well known that Building Automation technology is characterized by heterogeneity, in that solutions from different manufacturers cannot be easily integrated with each other, and that costumers are often forced to pick a single line of products, therefore, leading to costumer lock-in situations as well as increasing installation and maintenance costs. However, given the popularity of the subject, one startling aspect of Building Automation is the scarcity of authoritative literature references regarding the topic---definition inconsistency and disagreement are recurring issues. Moreover, automation technology specifications and manufacturer documentation are prevalently leading to a lack of coverage of the entire spectrum of functionality expected from modern automation systems. This results in communication difficulties between system developers further hindering the efforts to overcome heterogeneity. This article systematizes fundamental automation aspects, comprehensively defining each concept based upon established literature standards. Having these aspects as guidelines, we assess the required functionality of a Building Automation System and compare the main Building Automation specification standards available. We conclude that none of the analyzed specifications are able to totally cover the surveyed functionality span, leaving to developers and manufacturers the responsibility of creating custom extensions to fill functionality gaps, thus hindering the interoperability between different technologies.},

abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a novel approach how to process streaming events and extract information that would otherwise be lost. While tools for CEP are available right now, they are usually used only for a limited number of projects. That is disappointing, because every Enterprise Information System (EIS) is producing a high number of events, e.g. by logging debug information, and industry is not taking an advantage of CEP to make these information useful. We pick two concepts that seems to be from a different category - notifications - a ubiquitous way how to notify user of an EIS and EIS monitoring. With notifications we define a new abstraction upon notifications with respect to a separation of concerns to create a more maintainable implementation. In our research we show that this is a typical example of a possible future application of CEP and that the industry requires specific service oriented tools that can be used for both, notifications and monitoring. When these service oriented tools would be introduced into the industry it would promote EIS maintainability and extensibility. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Building automation systems are established to increase people's comfort and security with reduced energy consumption. The integration of wireless technologies into building control promises to make significant simplification in wiring requirements behind reduction of maintenance complexity and setup costs. This paper explores the application potential of wireless sensor/actuator networks in the building automation. We propose a prototype system design with sensor/actuator node structures to exhibit how to apply the wireless sensing and control techniques to the building automation. Proposed system instantly monitors indoor ambient conditions (temperature and humidity, light and motion information) on different floors of the building and automatically controls the home appliances (HVAC and lighting equipments) in an energy-efficient way. We also introduce a communication framework that establish data paths between the sensor and actuator nodes in scalable manner. Our system model can be effectively applied to large scale buildings, such as residences, shopping malls, skyscrapers, hotels, etc. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},
